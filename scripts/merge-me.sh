# Merges pull requests labeled `merge-me` — the label is standing intent ("merge when
# green"), not a command. Each evaluation checks the label, the PR's checks and its
# mergeability, then either merges, arms GitHub's server-side auto-merge, or holds
# (red stays labeled; the next event re-evaluates). Nothing here runs on a timer —
# every evaluation is triggered by a real event: the label, a push, a reopen, the ci
# workflow completing, or a manual dispatch (the scheduled sweep this design started
# with was removed in review; see issue #33 for the investigation, the rejected
# alternatives — the classic merge API and marketplace automerge actions both break
# on this repo's stacked PRs — and the tradeoffs).
#
#   ./scripts/merge-me.sh <pr-number> [--wait-minutes N] [--dry-run]
#       Evaluate one PR. Wait mode (default 15 min): pending checks are polled, so a
#       green outcome within the window merges in the same run. Used by the workflow's
#       pull_request trigger (labeled / synchronize / reopened) and, with a
#       zero-minute wait, by its ci-completion trigger (checks already finished).
#
#   ./scripts/merge-me.sh --all [--dry-run]
#       Instant evaluation of every open labeled PR — no waiting: green PRs merge,
#       pending ordinary PRs get auto-merge armed, everything else is left for the
#       event path. The manual escape hatch behind the workflow's workflow_dispatch
#       trigger (blank pr input), for replaying an evaluation lost to a transient
#       run failure.
#
# Exit 0 = merged, held (red/pending/conflict — re-evaluated later) or nothing to do;
# exit 1 = a merge was attempted and failed. Requires gh with GH_TOKEN (or a logged-in
# user) and read+write repository access.
